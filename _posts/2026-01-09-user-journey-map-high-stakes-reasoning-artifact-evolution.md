# User Journey Map: High-Stakes Reasoning & Artifact Evolution

## Overview
This journey map outlines the end-to-end experience of an Architect using the ThinkingCats platform to move from a complex problem statement to a persistent, version-controlled Reasoning Artifact. Unlike linear chat interfaces, this journey focuses on the recursive refinement of logic through an AI Expert Roundtable.

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **User Objective** | Define the boundaries of a complex problem and identify necessary expertise. | Subject the initial premise to cross-disciplinary AI critique. | Convert the dialectic into a structured, addressable reasoning node. | Refine, fork, and version the logic based on new data or human insight. | Encode the reasoning into the organization’s System of Record. |
| **User Actions** | Inputs high-level context, constraints, and desired outcomes. Selects specific Expert Personas (e.g., Systems Architect, Ethicist, Financial Strategist). | Prompts the panel for "Blindspot Analysis" or "Stress Testing." Intervenes to redirect the logic flow. | Reviews the synthesized summary. Assigns unique IDs to specific premises within the argument. | Updates parameters. "Forks" a reasoning chain to explore an alternative scenario. Views the version history. | Tags the artifact for discovery. Links the node to related projects within the Dynamic Knowledge Repository (DKR). |
| **AI Roundtable Interaction** | Analysis of intent. Recommendation of supplementary expert perspectives. Initial disambiguation of terms. | AI Experts debate one another. Logic is checked for fallacies. Cross-disciplinary trade-offs are identified and highlighted. | The "Orchestrator" model collapses the debate into a structured Artifact. Logic gaps are flagged for the user. | Models reassess the Artifact based on the "Fork." Historical versions are preserved to prevent cognitive drift. | Continuous monitoring of the Artifact against incoming data streams (if integrated). Suggestions for updates. |
| **System State** | **The Seed:** A raw, unstructured input linked to a specific user intent. | **The Dialectic:** A multi-threaded transcript of reasoning in progress. | **The Artifact v1.0:** A structured, versioned document with fine-grained addressability. | **The Living Logic:** A multi-versioned tree of thought with a clear audit trail of evolution. | **Institutional Memory:** A permanent, searchable node in the DKR. |
| **Key Value Metric** | Time-to-Context: How quickly the problem is framed. | Depth of Critique: Identification of non-obvious risks/opportunities. | Structural Integrity: The degree to which reasoning is modular and reusable. | Resilience: The ability to trace logic back to its origin through all iterations. | Network Effect: The utility of the artifact as a building block for future reasoning. |

## Detailed Interaction Touchpoints

### Phase 1: Problem Archeology
*   **Touchpoint:** The "Expert Selector" Interface.
*   **Experience:** The user does not simply "ask a question." They construct a "Reasoning Environment." The system suggests a "Devil’s Advocate" persona to ensure the premise is sufficiently challenged.

### Phase 2: Roundtable Orchestration
*   **Touchpoint:** The Live Dialectic Feed.
*   **Experience:** The user observes a "Roundtable" where the AI Ethics Expert argues with the AI Commercial Lead. The user pauses the interaction to add a "Constraint" (e.g., "We must assume a 20% interest rate environment"). The experts immediately recalibrate their positions.

### Phase 3: Logic Synthesis
*   **Touchpoint:** The Artifact Editor.
*   **Experience:** The system moves from a "Chat" to a "Document." Every paragraph in the resulting strategy is an addressable node. The user can click a premise to see the "Logic Trace"—the specific debate from Phase 2 that led to this conclusion.

### Phase 4: Artifact Evolution
*   **Touchpoint:** The Version Comparison View.
*   **Experience:** Six months later, the user returns. They "Fork" the reasoning to adapt to a market shift. The system highlights exactly which premises in the original logic are now invalid, preserving the original (Artifact v1.0) while building the new path (Artifact v2.0).

### Phase 5: Institutional Integration
*   **Touchpoint:** The DKR (Dynamic Knowledge Repository) Graph.
*   **Experience:** The finalized artifact is published to the organization’s DKR. When another team starts a new project, the ThinkingCats platform identifies the previous reasoning node as a "Parent Logic," preventing the organization from solving the same problem twice.

## Critical Success Factors for the Interaction
*   **Provenance:** Every statement in the final artifact must be traceable to a specific expert intervention or user input.
*   **Non-Linearity:** The user must be able to jump back to any point in the "Reasoning Chain" to change a premise without losing the subsequent work (automatic recalculation).
*   **Persistence:** Unlike disposable chat histories, the interaction must result in a "high-density asset" that lives in the company’s knowledge graph.
